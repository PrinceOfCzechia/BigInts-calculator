# BigInts-Calculator

A calculator built on arithmetics of BigInt type objects defined in my repository ['BigInts-library'](https://github.com/PrinceOfCzechia/BigInts-library). Also a school project for the subject C++ programming 2, as taught at Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering (FNSPE), Czech Technical University (CTU) Prague.

This calculator implements arithmetic operations (integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and powering) on custom type [BigInt](https://github.com/PrinceOfCzechia/BigInts-library). This allows for such operations, as adding *1* to the maximum size of *long long int* and getting a reasonable answer,
as is presented in the enclosed image.![bigIntCalc_loong](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72036926/186395384-a9c65216-aed6-416f-ac45-86b036f5de42.png)
